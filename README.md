## Building

The variable names `CFLAGS`, `ASFLAGS`, and `LDFLAGS` are a common convention used to organize flags for the C compiler, assembler, and linker, respectively.

Here's a breakdown of which flags go to which actor, with a special focus on the `-g` flag:

-----

### C Compiler (GCC)

  * **`CFLAGS = -m64 -fno-pie -no-pie -Wall`**: These flags are sent to `gcc` when it compiles C source code. In your `Makefile`, `gcc` is only used to link the object file, so these flags aren't directly applied to a compile step. However, if you had C code, they would be used.
      * `-m64`: Generates code for a 64-bit target.
      * `-fno-pie`, `-no-pie`: Disable Position Independent Executable, which is important for certain types of assembly code.
      * `-Wall`: Turns on all standard compiler warnings.

-----

### Assembler (NASM)

  * **`ASFLAGS = -f elf64 -F dwarf`**: These are flags for `nasm`.
      * `-f elf64`: Specifies the output format as 64-bit ELF, which is the standard format for Linux executables.
      * `-F dwarf`: Specifies the debug information format. DWARF is a standard format for debuggers. This flag is directly related to the `-g` flag's purpose.

-----

### Linker (GCC and `ld` under the hood)

  * **`LDFLAGS = -g`**: This is a flag for the **linker**, which, in your `Makefile`, is invoked by `gcc`. When you run `gcc` to link object files, it automatically calls the linker (`ld`) behind the scenes.
      * **`-g`**: This flag tells the linker to embed debugging symbols and information into the final executable. These symbols are essential for using a debugger like `gdb` to inspect variables, set breakpoints, and step through your code. It works in conjunction with the `-F dwarf` flag you passed to `nasm`, as `nasm` generates the raw debugging data in the object file, and the linker incorporates that data into the final executable.

AND [BP+SI],DX
AND QWORD [RDI],42
AND QWORD [RBX],0B80000H
```

#### **Notes**

`AND` performs the AND logical operation on its two operands. Once the operation is complete, the result replaces the destination operand. AND is performed on a bit-by-bit basis, such that bit 0 of the source is ANDed with bit 0 of the destination, bit 1 of the source is ANDed with bit 1 of the destination, and so on. The AND operation yields a 1 if both of the operands are 1; and a 0 only if either operand is 0. Note that the operation makes the Auxiliary carry flag undefined. CF and OF are cleared to 0, and the other affected flags are set according to the operation’s results.

> 🔔 Note: All conditional jumps rely on **flags** set by instructions like `CMP`, `TEST`, `SUB`, `ADD`, etc.

## False optimisation

From [xlat1gcc.asm](./chap09/xlat1gcc/xlat1gcc.asm)

On a modern, deeply pipelined CPU, conditional branching like this can be a performance killer if the branch predictor makes the wrong guess.

* The CPU tries to predict whether the `jb` or `ja` instruction will jump. If it predicts incorrectly, it has to discard all the work it has done speculatively, and the pipeline stalls while it fetches the correct instructions.
* If your input file is a mix of uppercase and lowercase, the branch predictor might get it wrong frequently, leading to significant performance penalties.

By eliminating the branching, you create a more predictable and streamlined code path for the CPU. The `xlat` instruction is a single, highly optimized instruction for this purpose, and the cost of an occasional `xlat` that translates a character to itself is far less than the potential cost of branch mispredictions on every loop iteration.

```asm
    ;.
    ;.
    ;.
Scan:
    xor rax, rax
    mov al, byte [rsi+rcx] ; Get character
; Skip uppercase characters
    cmp al, 41h   ; Test against 'A'
    jb Translate  ; if < 'A', must be something else, translate it
    cmp al, 5Ah   ; Test against 'Z'
    ja Translate  ; if > 'Z', must be something else, translate it
    jmp Next      ; if it's A-Z, skip translation
Translate:
    xlat
    mov byte [rsi+rcx], al
Next:
    inc rcx       ; Update loop counter
    cmp rcx, r12
    jb Scan       ; If RCX < R12 then Scan loop again
    ;.
    ;.
    ;.
```
